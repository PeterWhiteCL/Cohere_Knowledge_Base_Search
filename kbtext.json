A foster child is any child placed with you by an \nauthorized placement agency or by judgment, decree, or other \norder of any court of competent jurisdiction.\nKidnapped child.  If your child is presumed by law enforce-\nment authorities to have been kidnapped by someone who isn't a \nfamily member, you may be able to take the child into account \nin determining your eligibility for head of household or qualify-\ning surviving spouse filing status, the child tax credit, the credit \nfor other dependents, and the earned income credit (EIC). For \ndetails, see Pub. 501 (Pub. 596 for the EIC).\nMarried person.  If the person is married and files a joint re-\nturn, you can't claim that person as your dependent. However, if \nthe person is married but doesn't file a joint return or files a \njoint return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or es-\ntimated tax paid, you may be able to claim that person as a de-\npendent.

Even if a child \nmeets the conditions to be the qualifying child of more than one \nperson, only one person can claim the child as a qualifying child \nfor all of the following tax benefits, unless the special rule for \nChildren of divorced or separated parents,  described earlier, \napplies.\n1.Child tax credit and credit for other dependents (line 19) \nand additional child tax credit (line 28).\n2.Head of household filing status.\n3.Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule \n3, line 2).\n4.Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part \nIII).\n5.Earned income credit (line 27).No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed \nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can \nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. \nFor purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biologi-\ncal or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a step-\nparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the indi-\nvidual.\n\u2022If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is \ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent.\n\u2022If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the \nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying \nchild of the parents.\n\u2022If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both pa-\nrents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the \nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child \nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived \nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat \nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the high-\ner adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022.\n\u2022If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the \nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the \nhighest AGI for 2022.\n\u2022If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no \nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualify-\ning child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but \nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any \nparent of the child who can claim the child.\nExample. Your child, J, meets the conditions to be a quali-\nfying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the con-\nditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including \nJ\u2019s other parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J \nas a qualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for \nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of \nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s \nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying \nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent.\nFor more details and examples, see Pub. 501.\nIf you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to \nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on \nthis child.\nSocial security number.  You must enter each dependent's so-\ncial security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered \nagree with the dependent's social security card. Otherwise, at \nthe time we process your return, we may reduce or disallow any \ntax benefits (such as the child tax credit) based on that depend-\nent. If the name or SSN on the dependent's social security card \nisn't correct or you need to get an SSN for your dependent, con-\ntact the Social Security Administration (SSA). See Social Se-\ncurity Number (SSN) , earlier. If your dependent won't have a \nnumber by the date your return is due, see What if You Can't \nFile on Time?  earlier.\nFor the child tax credit, your child must have the required \nSSN. The required SSN is one that is valid for employment and \nthat is issued by the SSA before the due date of your 2022 re-\nturn (including extensions).

You bought 5,000 shares \nof XYZ Corp. common stock on July 8, \n2022. XYZ Corp. paid a cash dividend \nof 10 cents per share. The ex -dividend \ndate was July 16, 2022. Your Form \n1099- DIV from XYZ Corp. shows $500 \nin box 1a (ordinary dividends) and in \nbox 1b (qualified dividends). However, \nyou sold the 5,000 shares on August 11, \n2022. You held your shares of XYZ \nCorp. for only 34 days of the 121 -day \nperiod (from July 9, 2022, through Au-\ngust 11, 2022). The 121 -day period be-\ngan on May 17, 2022 (60 days before \nthe ex -dividend date), and ended on \nSeptember 14, 2022.

The pre-\nmiums can be for coverage for you, your \nspouse, or dependents. The distribution \nmust be from a plan maintained by the \nemployer from which you retired as a \npublic safety officer. Also, the distribu-\ntion must be made directly from the plan \nto the provider of the accident or health \nplan or long -term care insurance con-\ntract. You can exclude from income the \nsmaller of the amount of the premiums \nor $3,000. You can make this election only for amounts that would otherwise \nbe included in your income.\nAn eligible retirement plan is a gov-\nernmental plan that is a qualified trust or \na section 403(a), 403(b), or 457(b) plan.\nIf you make this election, reduce the \notherwise taxable amount of your pen-\nsion or annuity by the amount excluded. \nThe amount shown in box 2a of Form \n1099- R doesn't reflect the exclusion.

Include in your income \nany payments you receive from a \n401(k), pension, or other retirement plan \nto the extent that you would have re-\nceived the amount at the same or later \ntime regardless of whether you had be-\ncome disabled.\nExample. Taxpayer J, a contractor, \nwas disabled as a direct result of partici-\npating in efforts to clean up the World \nTrade Center. J is eligible for compensa-\ntion by the September 11 Victim Com-\npensation Fund. J began receiving a dis-\nability pension at age 55 when J could \nno longer continue working because of \nJ\u2019s disability. Under J\u2019s pension plan, at \nage 55, J is entitled to an early retire-\nment benefit of $2,500. If J waits until \nage 62, normal retirement age under the \nplan, J would be entitled to a normal re-\ntirement benefit of $3,000 a month. The \npension plan provides that a participant \nwho retires early on account of disability \nis entitled to receive the participant's \nnormal retirement benefit, which in J's \ncase equals $3,000 per month. Until J \nturns age 62, J can exclude $500 of the monthly retirement benefit from income \n(the difference between the early retire-\nment benefit and the normal retirement \nbenefit, $3,000 - $2,500) received on ac-\ncount of disability. J must report the re-\nmaining $2,500 of monthly pension ben-\nefit as taxable. For each month after J \nturns age 62, J must report the full \namount of the monthly pension benefit \n($3,000 a month) as taxable.\nSimplified Method\nYou must use the Simplified Method if \neither of the following applies.\n1.Your annuity starting date was af-\nter July 1, 1986, and you used this meth-\nod last year to figure the taxable part.\n2.Your annuity starting date was af-\nter November 18, 1996, and both of the \nfollowing apply.\na.The payments are from a quali-\nfied employee plan, a qualified employ-\nee annuity, or a tax-sheltered annuity.\nb.On your annuity starting date, ei-\nther you were under age 75 or the num-\nber of years of guaranteed payments was \nfewer than 5.

MUST be removed before printing.\nNo other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed \nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can \nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. \nFor purposes of these rules, the term \u201cparent\u201dmeans a biological \nor adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a steppar-\nent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individu-\nal.\n\u2022If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is \ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent.\n\u2022If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the \nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying \nchild of the parents.\n\u2022If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both pa-\nrents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the \nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child \nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived \nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat \nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the high-\ner adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022.\n\u2022If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the \nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the \nhighest AGI for 2022.\n\u2022If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no \nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualify-\ning child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but \nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any \nparent of the child who can claim the child.\nIf, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a quali-\nfying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the \nEIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying \nchild. For more information, see Pub. 596.\nExample. Your child J, meets the conditions to be a qualify-\ning child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the condi-\ntions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s \nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a \nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed here for \nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the \nfive tax benefits listed here based on J. However, if your pa-\nrent\u2019s AGI is higher than yours and you don\u2019t claim J as a quali-\nfying child, J is the qualifying child of your parent.\nFor more details and examples, see Pub. 596.\nTIPSocial security number (SSN).  For the EIC, a valid SSN is a \nnumber issued by the Social Security Administration unless \n\u201cNot Valid for Employment\u201d is printed on the social security \ncard and the number was issued solely to allow the recipient of \nthe SSN to apply for or receive a federally funded benefit. How-\never, if \u201cValid for Work Only With DHS Authorization\u201d is prin-\nted on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC pur-\nposes only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid.\nTo find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number \n(SSN)  near the beginning of these instructions. If you won't \nhave an SSN by the date your return is due, see What if You \nCan't File on Time?\nIf you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of \nyour 2022 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC \non your original or an amended 2022 return. If a child didn't \nhave an SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (in-\ncluding extensions), you can't count that child as a qualifying \nchild in figuring the amount of the EIC on your original or an \namended 2022 return.\nStudent. A student is a child who during any part of 5 calendar \nmonths of 2022 was enrolled as a full -time student at a school \nor took a full -time, on- farm training course given by a school or \na state, county, or local government agency. A school includes a \ntechnical, trade, or mechanical school. It doesn't include an \non-the- job training course, correspondence school, or school of-\nfering courses only through the Internet.\nWelfare benefits, effect of credit on.  Any refund you receive \nas a result of taking the EIC can't be counted as income when \ndetermining if you or anyone else is eligible for benefits or as-\nsistance, or how much you or anyone else can receive, under \nany federal program or under any state or local program fi-\nnanced in whole or in part with federal funds. These programs \ninclude Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), \nMedicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Supple-\nmental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps). In \naddition, when determining eligibility, the refund can't be coun-\nted as a resource for at least 12 months after you receive it. \nCheck with your local benefit coordinator to find out if your re-\nfund will affect your benefits.\nNeed more information or forms?

If you are filing online using \nsoftware, you must use a Self -Select \nPIN. If you are filing electronically us-\ning a tax practitioner, you can use a \nSelf- Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN. \nFor 2022, if we issued you an identity \nprotection personal identification num-\nber (IP PIN) (as described in more detail \nbelow), all six digits of your IP PIN \nmust appear in the IP PIN spaces provi-ded next to the space for your occupa-\ntion for your electronic signature to be \ncomplete.

If you are filing a joint return and \nboth taxpayers were issued an IP PIN, \nenter both IP PINs in the spaces provi-\nded.\nSelf- Select PIN.  The Self -Select PIN \nmethod allows you to create your own \nPIN. If you are married filing jointly, \nyou and your spouse will each need to \ncreate a PIN and enter these PINs as \nyour electronic signatures.\nA PIN is any combination of five dig-\nits you choose except five zeros. If you \nuse a PIN, there is nothing to sign and \nnothing to mail \u2014not even your Forms \nW-2.\nYour electronic return is considered a \nvalidly signed return only when it in-\ncludes your PIN, last name, date of \nbirth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your ad-\njusted gross income (AGI) from your \noriginally filed 2021 federal income tax \nreturn, if applicable. If you're filing \njointly, your electronic return must also \ninclude your spouse's PIN, last name, \ndate of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and \nAGI, if applicable, in order to be consid-\nered validly signed. Don\u2019t use your AGI \nfrom an amended return (Form 1040 -X) \nor a math error correction made by the \nIRS. AGI is the amount shown on your \n2021 Form 1040 or 1040 -SR, line 11.

(If you filed elec-\ntronically last year, you, and your \nspouse if filing jointly, may use your \nprior year PIN to verify your identity in-\nstead of your prior year AGI. The prior \nyear PIN is the five -digit PIN you used \nto electronically sign your 2021 return.)\nYou can't use the Self -Select \nPIN method if you are a \nfirst- time filer under age 16 at \nthe end of 2022.\nPractitioner PIN.

One of the \nbest ways to file an accurate return is to \nfile electronically. Tax software does the \nmath for you and will help you avoid \nmistakes. You may be eligible to use \nfree tax software that will take the \nguesswork out of preparing your return. \nFree File makes available free \nbrand- name software and free e-file . \nVisit IRS.gov/FreeFile  for details. Join \nthe eight in 10 taxpayers who get their \nrefunds faster by using direct deposit \nand e-file .\n\u2022File your return on a standard size \nsheet of paper. Cutting the paper may \ncause problems in processing your re-\nturn.\n\u2022Make sure you entered the correct \nname and social security number (SSN) \nfor each dependent you claim in the De-\npendents  section. Check that each de-\npendent's name and SSN agrees with the \ndependent\u2019s social security card. For \neach child under age 17 who is a quali-\nfying child for the child tax credit or \neach dependent who qualifies you for \nthe credit for other dependents, make \nsure you checked the appropriate box in \ncolumn (4) of the Dependents  section.\n\u2022Check your math, especially for \nthe child tax credit, earned income credit \n(EIC), taxable social security benefits, \ntotal income, itemized deductions or \nstandard deduction, taxable income, to-\ntal tax, federal income tax withheld, and \nrefund or amount you owe.\n\u2022Be sure you used the correct meth-\nod to figure your tax. See the instruc-\ntions for line 16.\n\u2022Be sure to enter your SSN in the \nspace provided on page 1 of Form 1040 \nor 1040 -SR. If you are married filing a joint or separate return, also enter your \nspouse's SSN. Be sure to enter your SSN \nin the space next to your name. Check \nthat your name and SSN agree with your \nsocial security card.\n\u2022Make sure your name and address \nare correct. Enter your (and your spou-\nse's) name in the same order as shown \non your last return.\n\u2022If you live in an apartment, be sure \nto include your apartment number in \nyour address.\n\u2022If you are taking the standard de-\nduction, see the instructions for line 12 \nto be sure you entered the correct \namount.\n\u2022If you received capital gain distri-\nbutions but weren't required to file \nSchedule D, make sure you checked the \nbox on line 7.\n\u2022If you are taking the EIC, be sure \nyou used the correct column of the EIC \nTable for your filing status and the num-\nber of qualifying children you have who \nhave valid SSNs.\n\u2022Remember to sign and date Form \n1040 or 1040- SR and enter your occupa-\ntion(s).\n\u2022Attach your Form(s) W -2 and oth-\ner required forms and schedules. Put all \nforms and schedules in the proper order. \nSee Assemble Your Return,  earlier.\n\u2022If you owe tax and are paying by \ncheck or money order, be sure to include \nall the required information on your pay-\nment. See the instructions for line 37 for \ndetails.\n\u2022Make sure to check Where Do You \nFile?  before mailing your return. Over \nthe next several years, the IRS will be \nreducing the number of paper tax return \nprocessing sites. Because of this, you \nmay need to mail your return to a differ-\nent address than you have in the past.\n\u2022Don\u2019t file more than one original \nreturn for the same year, even if you \nhaven't gotten your refund or haven't \nheard from the IRS since you filed. Fil-\ning more than one original return for the \nsame year, or sending in more than one \ncopy of the same return (unless we ask \nyou to do so), could delay your refund.\u2022Make sure that if you, your spouse \nwith whom you are filing a joint return, \nor your dependent was enrolled in Mar-\nketplace coverage, and advance pay-\nments of the premium tax credit were \nmade for the coverage, that you attach \nForm 8962. For tax years other than \n2020, you may have to repay excess ad-\nvance payments, even if someone else \nenrolled you, your spouse, or your de-\npendent in the Marketplace coverage. \nExcess advance payments may also have \nto be repaid if you enrolled someone in \nMarketplace coverage, you don't claim \nthat individual as a dependent, and no \none else claims that individual as a de-\npendent. See the instructions for Sched-\nule 2, line 2, and the Instructions for \nForm 8962. You or whoever enrolled \nyou should have received Form 1095 -A \nfrom the Marketplace with information \nabout who was covered and any advance \npayments of the premium tax credit.\nInnocent Spouse Relief\nGenerally, both you and your spouse are \neach responsible for paying the full \namount of tax, interest, and penalties on \nyour joint return. However, you may \nqualify for relief from liability for tax on \na joint return if (a) there is an under-\nstatement of tax because your spouse \nomitted income or claimed false deduc-\ntions or credits; (b) you are divorced, \nseparated, or no longer living with your \nspouse; or (c) given all the facts and cir-\ncumstances, it wouldn't be fair to hold \nyou liable for the tax. You may also \nqualify for relief if you were a married \nresident of a community property state \nbut didn't file a joint return and are now \nliable for an unpaid or understated tax. \nFile Form 8857 to request relief. In \nsome cases, Form 8857 may need to be \nfiled within 2 years of the date on which \nthe IRS first attempted to collect the tax \nfrom you. Don\u2019t file Form 8857 with \nyour Form 1040 or 1040 -SR.

A person-\nal representative can be an executor, ad-\nministrator, or anyone who is in charge \nof the deceased taxpayer's property.

The penalty \ncan be as much as 25% of the tax due. \nThe penalty is 15% per month, up to a \nmaximum of 75%, if the failure to file is \nfraudulent.

We must \nalso tell you what could happen if we do \nnot receive it and whether your response \nis voluntary, required to obtain a benefit, \nor mandatory under the law.\nThis notice applies to all records and \nother material (in paper or electronic for-\nmat) you file with us, including this tax \nreturn. It also applies to any questions we \nneed to ask you so we can complete, cor-\nrect, or process your return; figure your \ntax; and collect tax, interest, or penalties.\nOur legal right to ask for information \nis Internal Revenue Code sections 6001, \n6011, and 6012(a), and their regulations. \nThey say that you must file a return or \nstatement with us for any tax you are lia-\nble for. Your response is mandatory under \nthese sections. Code section 6109 re-\nquires you to provide your identifying \nnumber on the return. This is so we know \nwho you are, and can process your return \nand other papers. You must fill in all parts \nof the tax form that apply to you. But you \ndo not have to check the boxes for the \nPresidential Election Campaign Fund or \nfor the third -party designee. You also do \nnot have to provide your daytime phone \nnumber or email address.\nYou are not required to provide the in-\nformation requested on a form that is sub-\nject to the Paperwork Reduction Act un-\nless the form displays a valid OMB con-\ntrol number. Books or records relating to \na form or its instructions must be retained \nas long as their contents may become ma-\nterial in the administration of any Internal \nRevenue law.\nWe ask for tax return information to \ncarry out the tax laws of the United \nStates. We need it to figure and collect \nthe right amount of tax.\nIf you do not file a return, do not pro-\nvide the information we ask for, or pro-\nvide fraudulent information, you may be \ncharged penalties and be subject to crimi-\nnal prosecution. We may also have to dis-\nallow the exemptions, exclusions, credits, \ndeductions, or adjustments shown on the tax return. This could make the tax higher \nor delay any refund. Interest may also be \ncharged.\nGenerally, tax returns and return infor-\nmation are confidential, as stated in Code \nsection 6103. However, Code section \n6103 allows or requires the Internal Reve-\nnue Service to disclose or give the infor-\nmation shown on your tax return to others \nas described in the Code. For example, \nwe may disclose your tax information to \nthe Department of Justice to enforce the \ntax laws, both civil and criminal, and to \ncities, states, the District of Columbia, \nand U.S. commonwealths or possessions \nto carry out their tax laws. We may dis-\nclose your tax information to the Depart-\nment of Treasury and contractors for tax \nadministration purposes; and to other per-\nsons as necessary to obtain information \nneeded to determine the amount of or to \ncollect the tax you owe. We may disclose \nyour tax information to the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States to permit the \nComptroller General to review the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service. We may disclose \nyour tax information to committees of \nCongress; federal, state, and local child \nsupport agencies; and to other federal \nagencies for the purposes of determining \nentitlement for benefits or the eligibility \nfor and the repayment of loans. We may \nalso disclose this information to other \ncountries under a tax treaty, to federal and \nstate agencies to enforce federal nontax \ncriminal laws, or to federal law enforce-\nment and intelligence agencies to combat \nterrorism.\nPlease keep this notice with your re-\ncords. It may help you if we ask you for \nother information. If you have questions \nabout the rules for filing and giving infor-\nmation, please call or visit any Internal \nRevenue Service office.\nWe Welcome Comments on \nForms\nWe try to create forms and instructions \nthat can be easily understood. Often this \nis difficult to do because our tax laws are \nvery complex. For some people with in-\ncome mostly from wages, filling in the \nforms is easy. For others who have busi-\nnesses, pensions, stocks, rental income, or \nother investments, it is more difficult.If you have suggestions for making \nthese forms simpler, we would be happy \nto hear from you. You can send us com-\nments through IRS.gov/FormsComments . \nOr you can send your comments to Inter-\nnal Revenue Service, Tax Forms and Pub-\nlications Division, 1111 Constitution \nAve. NW, IR -6526, Washington, DC \n20224. Don\u2019t send your return to this ad-\ndress. Instead, see the addresses at the end \nof these instructions.\nAlthough we can't respond individual-\nly to each comment received, we do ap-\npreciate your feedback and will consider \nyour comments as we revise our tax \nforms and instructions.\nEstimates of Taxpayer \nBurden\nThe following table shows burden esti-\nmates based on current statutory require-\nments as of November 2022 for taxpayers \nfiling a 2022 Form 1040 or 1040 -SR tax \nreturn. Time spent and out -of-pocket \ncosts are presented separately. Time bur-\nden is broken out by taxpayer activity, \nwith recordkeeping representing the larg-\nest component. Out -of-pocket costs in-\nclude any expenses incurred by taxpayers \nto prepare and submit their tax returns. \nExamples include tax return preparation \nand submission fees, postage and photo-\ncopying costs, and tax return preparation \nsoftware costs. While these estimates \ndon\u2019t include burden associated with \npost- filing activities, IRS operational data \nindicate that electronically prepared and \nfiled returns have fewer arithmetic errors, \nimplying lower post-filing burden.\nReported time and cost burdens are na-\ntional averages and don\u2019t necessarily re-\nflect a \u201ctypical\u201d case. Most taxpayers ex-\nperience lower than average burden, with \ntaxpayer burden varying considerably by \ntaxpayer type. For instance, the estimated \naverage time burden for all taxpayers fil-\ning a Form 1040 or 1040 -SR is 13 hours, \nwith an average cost of $250 per return. \nThis average includes all associated forms \nand schedules, across all tax return prepa-\nration methods and taxpayer activities.\nWithin this estimate, there is signifi-\ncant variation in taxpayer activity. For ex-\nample, nonbusiness taxpayers are expec-\nted to have an average burden of about 8 \n-106-Page 107 of 113  Fileid: \u2026 ions/i1040/2022/a/xml/cycle11/source 14:28 - 20-Jan-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Similarly, tax \nreturn preparation fees and other \nout-of- pocket costs vary extensively de-pending on the tax situation of the taxpay-\ner, the type of software or professional \npreparer used, and the geographic loca-\ntion.If you have comments concerning the \ntime and cost estimates below, you can \ncontact us at either one of the addresses \nshown under We Welcome Comments on \nForms .\nEstimated Average Taxpayer Burden for Individuals by Activity\nAverage Burden\nAverage Time (Hours) Average\nCost\n(Dollars)**\nType of TaxpayerPercentage\nof ReturnsTotal\nTime*Record-\nkeepingTax\n PlanningForm\nCompletion \nand \nSubmissionAll\nOther\n........\nAll taxpayers .......... 100% 13 6 2 4 1 $250\nType of taxpayer\nNonbusiness*** ..... 72% 8 3 1 3 1 140\nBusiness*** ....... 28% 25 12 5 6 2 530\n *Detail may not add to total time due to rounding. \n**Dollars rounded to the nearest $10.\n***You are considered a \u201cbusiness\u201d filer if you file one or more of the following with Form 1040 or 1040-SR: Schedule C, E, or F or Form 2106.

The budget plan sets \nforth the President's proposed receipts, \nspending, and the surplus or deficit for \nthe federal government. The plan includes \nrecommendations for new legislation as \nwell as recommendations to change, elim-\ninate, and add programs. After receipt of \nthe President's proposal, the Congress re-\nviews the proposal and makes changes. It \nfirst passes a budget resolution setting its \nown targets for receipts, outlays, and sur-\nplus or deficit. Next, individual spending \nand revenue bills that are consistent with \nthe goals of the budget resolution are \nenacted.\nIn fiscal year 2021 (which began on \nOctober 1, 2020, and ended on September 30, 2021), federal income was $4. 047 tril-\nlion and outlays were $6.882 trillion, \nleaving a deficit of $2.775 trillion.\nFootnotes for Certain Federal \nOutlays\n1.Social security, Medicare, and \nother retirement:  These programs pro-\nvide income support for the retired and \ndisabled and medical care for the elderly.\n2.National defense, veterans, and \nforeign affairs:  About 11% of outlays \nwere to equip, modernize, and pay our \narmed forces and to fund national defense \nactivities; about 3% were for veterans \nbenefits and services; and about 1% were \nfor international activities, including mili-\ntary and economic assistance to foreign countries and the maintenance of U.S. \nembassies abroad.\n3.Physical, human, and communi-\nty development:  These outlays were for \nagriculture; natural resources; environ-\nment; transportation; aid for elementary \nand secondary education and direct assis-\ntance to college students; job training; de-\nposit insurance, commerce and housing \ncredit, and community development; and \nspace, energy, and general science pro-\ngrams.\n4.Social programs:  About 22% of \ntotal outlays were for Medicaid, Supple-\nmental Nutrition Assistance Program \n(formerly food stamps), temporary assis-\ntance for needy families, supplemental se-\ncurity income, and related programs; and \n11% for health research and public health \nprograms, unemployment compensation, \nassisted housing, and social services.\nNote.  The percentages shown here exclude undistributed offsetting receipts, which were $124 billion in fiscal year 2021. In the budget, these receipts are offset against spending in figuring the outlay totals shown above. \nThese receipts are for the U.S. Government's share of its employee retirement programs, rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf, and proceeds from the sale of assets.\n-108-Page 109 of 113  Fileid: \u2026 ions/i1040/2022/a/xml/cycle11/source 14:28 - 20-Jan-2023\nThe type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.
